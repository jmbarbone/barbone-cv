  abstract = {{BACKGROUND & AIMS}. Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis ({NASH}) is a chronic liver disease associated with adverse clinical outcomes and impaired health-related quality of life ({HRQL}). {METHODS}. Patients with biopsy-proven non-cirrhotic {NASH} with hepatic fat fraction of =10% by {MRI}-proton density fat fraction ({MRI-PDFF}) were enrolled in a Phase 2, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study of resmetirom. {HRQL} was assessed using {S}hort {F}orm-36 ({SF}-36) throughout 36 weeks of treatment. {RESULTS}. 125 NASH patients were enrolled (50  11 years old, 50% male, 94% white, {BMI} 35+-6, 39% with diabetes mellitus). Of these, 84 patients received 80 mg of resmetirom daily and 41 received placebo. At baseline, {HRQL} scores were not different from general population norms ({P}hysical {C}omponent {S}ummary ({PCS}) 47.9    9.3 vs. 50, {M}ental {C}omponent {S}ummary 50.4    10.0 vs. 50; all p>0.05). By treatment week 12, patients who received resmetirom experienced improvement of {B}odily {P}ain and {SF-6D} utility scores (p<0.05); no {HRQL} improvement was noted in placebo (all p>0.05). Improvement in {PCS} continued upto week 36 of treatment with resmetirom; again with no improvement in placebo group (all p>0.05). Adjusted for the baseline score and clinico-demographic confounders, meeting the endpoint of a decrease in {PDFF} of >=30% by week 12 (met by 54/116 treatment completers; 47/54 on resmetirom) was independently associated with greater improvements in {P}hysical {Functioning} and {PCS} scores at week 36 (p<0.05). Patients with improvement in {NASH} and fibrosis on liver biopsy also showed improvement in components of {HRQL}. {CONCLUSIONS}. Patients with {NASH} treated who improved their hepatic fat fraction and/or {NAS} on serial liver biopsy experienced improvement of {HRQL}. Further studies are needed to confirm long-term sustainability of that improvement ({ClinicalTrials.gov #NCT02912260}).},
