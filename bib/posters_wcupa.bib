  abstract = {The methodologies through which music s effects have been studied in cognitive experiments have serious issues that ought to be addressed. Among these are the selection of the music stimuli, which is often overlooked and completed poorly, and the selection of task measures. Allowing participants to select their own music for cognitive control experiments may be a valid method of studying potential effects under more realistic and relevant conditions. Experiments have used novel songs without regard to participant preference and tasks that are not usually paired with listening to music. A survey of undergraduates shows that investigations with specific genres and cognitive tasks are not geared to students. Students report higher rates of listening to music during tasks which require more executive-functioning and report music s effectiveness to be related to preventing boredom and drowning out background noise. An experiment informed by these results was designed to test students under conditions of silence, self-selected music, and randomly-selected music from a pool of songs generate by the survey. Students were tested on three tasks related to executive functioning and one verbal task from the Penn Computerized Neurocognitive Battery. Results showed little difference in performance on these tasks among the testing condition.},
