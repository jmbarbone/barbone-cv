  abstract = {c(" {Type {III} collagen is a key component of liver fibrosis in NASH patients. N-terminal type {III} collagen pro-peptide (PRO-C3) are serum markers reflecting formation of type {III} collagen (pathologic collagen that is increased in the liver in advanced NASH fibrosis). Matrix metalloproteinase-degraded collagen {III} (C3M) degrades existing collagen {III} which is present in fibrotic livers. A reduction in {PRO-C3} and/or elevation in {C3M} levels reflected by the {PRO-C3/C3M} ratio may be indicative of an overall decrease in liver fibrosis. We evaluated the effect of resmetirom treatment on {PRO-C3}, {C3M} and {PRO-C3/C3M} ratio in the Phase 2 study.  {MGL}-3196-05 (NCT02912260) was a 36-week multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled serial {MRI-PDFF}, paired liver biopsy Phase 2 study in adults with biopsy-confirmed NASH (NAS >", 
"4, F1-F3) and hepatic fat fraction  10%, assessed by {MRI-PDFF} (main study). Thirty-one patients (including 14 former placebo patients) received open-label {MGL}-3196 in the 36-week extension study.  Baseline {PRO-C3} and {PRO-C3/C3M} ratio levels were significantly correlated with baseline fibrosis stage (Correlation coefficient (cc)", " 0.24, p ", " 0.001) and ballooning (cc", "0.29, p", "0.003). {PRO-C3} levels declined in patients treated with resmetirom relative to placebo (p < 0.0001) in the main study [Lancet 394, 2012-2024, 2019]. {C3M} levels increased slightly with resmetirom treatment, with no change in placebo. The {PRO-C3/C3M} ratio declined in resmetirom compared with placebo treatment in the main study (resmetirom, -0.24; placebo, 0.42, p<0.001) and significantly decreased in the extension study, in which all patients were treated with resmetirom (-0.50, p < 0.0001) (figure).  In conclusion, {PRO-C3} levels and {PRO-C3/C3M} ratios were correlated to fibrosis stage and NAS components at baseline. Treatment of NASH patients with resmetirom produced significant reductions in {PRO-C3} levels and {PRO-C3/C3M} ratio, which may reflect a net reduction in collagen deposition and fibrosis.},"
